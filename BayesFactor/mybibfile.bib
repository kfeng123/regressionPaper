  abstract  = {Linear mixed-effects models are an important class of statistical models that are used directly in many fields of applications and also are used as iterative steps in fitting other types of mixed-effects models, such as generalized linear mixed models. The parameters in these models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. In general, there is no closed-form solution for these estimates and they must be determined by iterative algorithms such as \{EM\} iterations or general nonlinear optimization. Many of the intermediate calculations for such iterations have been expressed as generalized least squares problems. We show that an alternative representation as a penalized least squares problem has many advantageous computational properties including the ability to evaluate explicitly a profiled log-likelihood or log-restricted likelihood, the gradient and Hessian of this profiled objective, and an \{ECME\} update to refine this objective. },

To calibrate the selection procedures, we define new tuning parameter selectors based on the scores. Large-sample properties of these new tuning parameter selectors are established for the proposed procedures. These new methods are compared in simulations and a real-data application with competing methods where one ignores measurement error or uses the Bayesian information criterion to choose the tuning parameter. },

  abstract  = {Abstract This article concerns the tests for the equality of two location parameters when the data dimension is larger than the sample size. Existing spatial-sign-based procedures are not robust with respect to high dimensionality, producing tests with the type-I error rates that are much larger than the nominal levels. We develop a correction that makes the sign-based tests applicable for high-dimensional data, allowing the dimensionality to increase as the square of the sample size. We show that the proposed test statistic is asymptotically normal under elliptical distributions and demonstrate that it has good size and power in a wide range of settings by simulation. },

In the last decade, rapid development has occurred in the field and many of these conditions are now known to be equivalent. We survey the subject, make the equivalences explicit, and list some groups of statistical interest which do, and also some which do not, have these properties. In particular, it is shown that the existence of the asymptotically invariant sequence of probabilities in the hypothesis of the Hunt-Stein theorem is equivalent to amenability, a condition that has been much studied by functional analysts.},

It does not require the computation of the MLEs of the parameters or a search for multiple maxima, but requires computations based on `classification likelihood' assignments of observations to mixture components.},

  abstract      = {Summary.  We examine philosophical problems and sampling deficiencies that are associated with current Bayesian hypothesis testing methodology, paying particular attention to objective Bayes methodology. Because the prior densities that are used to define alternative hypotheses in many Bayesian tests assign non‐negligible probability to regions of the parameter space that are consistent with null hypotheses, resulting tests provide exponential accumulation of evidence in favour of true alternative hypotheses, but only sublinear accumulation of evidence in favour of true null hypotheses. Thus, it is often impossible for such tests to provide strong evidence in favour of a true null hypothesis, even when moderately large sample sizes have been obtained. We review asymptotic convergence rates of Bayes factors in testing precise null hypotheses and propose two new classes of prior densities that ameliorate the imbalance in convergence rates that is inherited by most Bayesian tests. Using members of these classes, we obtain analytic expressions for Bayes factors in linear models and derive approximations to Bayes factors in large sample settings.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel test procedure for repeated measurements based on the penalized likelihood ratio (PLR). The procedure provides an alternative to the standard likelihood ratio tests for evaluating null hypotheses concerning the correlation structure of repeated measurements. PLR tests are specifically designed for nonstandard test situations where non-identifiability of a nuisance parameter occurs under the null hypothesis. The idea is to penalize the estimation close to the boundary of the domain of the nuisance parameter and thereby eliminate the non-identifiability. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the PLR test is a 50:50 mixture of chi-square distributions with 0 and 1 degrees of freedom. Simulation studies indicate that the asymptotic distribution of the PLR test provides a good approximation, even for fairly small data sets (10--20 subjects). A sensitivity analysis with a real data example highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the test procedure.},

They prove that the limiting distribution of this statistic is the squared supremum of a truncated standard Gaussian process. The autocorrelation function of the Gaussian process is explicitly presented. A re‐sampling procedure is recommended to obtain the asymptotic p‐value. Three kernel functions, normal, binomial and Poisson, are used in a simulation study which illustrates the procedure.},

  abstract = {In a Bayesian analysis of finite mixture models, parameter estimation and clustering are sometimes less straightforward than might be expected. In particular, the common practice of estimating parameters by their posterior mean, and summarizing joint posterior distributions by marginal distributions, often leads to nonsensical answers. This is due to the so‐called ‘label switching’ problem, which is caused by symmetry in the likelihood of the model parameters. A frequent response to this problem is to remove the symmetry by using artificial identifiability constraints. We demonstrate that this fails in general to solve the problem, and we describe an alternative class of approaches, relabelling algorithms, which arise from attempting to minimize the posterior expected loss under a class of loss functions. We describe in detail one particularly simple and general relabelling algorithm and illustrate its success in dealing with the label switching problem on two examples.},

In univariate Bayesian linear regression with a single response y , shrinkage priors which can be expressed as scale mixtures of normalnormal densities are popular for obtaining sparse estimates of the coefficients. In this paper, we extend the use of these priors to the multivariate case to estimate a p × q coefficients matrix B . We derive sufficient conditions for posterior consistency under the Bayesian multivariate linear regression framework and prove that our method achieves posterior consistency even when p &gt; n andeven when p grows at nearly exponential rate with the sample size. We derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm and provide the implementation in a comprehensive R package called MBSP. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations and data analysis that our model has excellent finite sample performance. },

We propose to add a particular type of penalty function to the log‐likelihood function. The resulting penalized likelihood‐ratio statistics have simple limiting distributions when applied to finite mixture models with multinomial observations. The method is especially effective in addressing the problems discussed by Chernoff and Lander (1995). The theory developed and simulations conducted show that the penalized likelihood method can give very good results, better than the well‐known C(α) procedure, for example. The paper does not, however, fully explore the choice of penalty function and weight. The full potential of the new procedure is to be explored in the future.},

The problem of testing the hypothesis k=2 versusk3 is studied. There has been no general statistical testing procedure for this problem. We propose a modified likelihood ratio statistic where under the null and the alternative hypotheses the estimates of the parameters are obtained from a modified likelihood function. It is shown that estimators of the support points are consistent. The asymptotic null distribution of the modified likelihood ratio test proposed is derived and found to be relatively simple and easily applied. Simulation studies for the asymptotic modified likelihood ratio test based on finite mixture models with normal, binomial and Poisson kernels suggest that the test proposed performs well. Simulation studies are also conducted for a bootstrap method with normal kernels. An example involving foetal movement data from a medical study illustrates the testing procedure.},

In particular, I explain how posterior concentration rates can be derived and what we learn from such analysis in terms of the impact of the prior distribution on high-dimensional models. These results concern fully Bayes and empirical Bayes procedures. I also describe some of the results that have been obtained recently in semiparametric models, focusing mainly on the Bernstein–von Mises property. Although these results are theoretical in nature, they shed light on some subtle behaviors of the prior models and sharpen our understanding of the family of functionals that can be well estimated for a given prior model. },

However, he also explored many other lesser known aspects of mathematical statistics. This is a survey of one of those areas, initiated by a seminal paper in 2005, on high dimension low sample size asymptotics. An interesting characteristic of that first paper, and of many of the following papers, is that they contain deep and insightful concepts which are frequently surprising and counter‐intuitive, yet have mathematical underpinnings which tend to be direct and not difficult to prove.},

  abstract      = {In this article, we focus on the problem of testing the equality of several high dimensional mean vectors with unequal covariance matrices. This is one of the most important problems in multivariate statistical analysis and there have been various tests proposed in the literature. Motivated by Bai and Saranadasa (Stat Sin 6:311--329, 1996) and Chen and Qin (Ann Stat 38:808--835, 2010), we introduce a test statistic and derive the asymptotic distributions under the null and the alternative hypothesis. In addition, it is compared with a test statistic recently proposed by Srivastava and Kubokawa (J Multivar Anal 115:204--216, 2013). It is shown that our test statistic performs better especially in the large dimensional case.},

This review provides a selective survey of some recent developments in hypothesis testing for high-dimensional covariance structures, including global testing for the overall pattern of the covariance structures and simultaneous testing of a large collection of hypotheses on the local covariance structures with false discovery proportion and false discovery rate control. Both one-sample and two-sample settings are considered. The specific testing problems discussed include global testing for the covariance, correlation, and precision matrices, and multiple testing for the correlations, Gaussian graphical models, and differential networks. },

  abstract      = {Summary Principal component analysis (PCA) is a method of choice for dimension reduction. In the current context of data explosion, online techniques that do not require storing all data in memory are indispensable to perform the PCA of streaming data and/or massive data. Despite the wide availability of recursive algorithms that can efficiently update the PCA when new data are observed, the literature offers little guidance on how to select a suitable algorithm for a given application. This paper reviews the main approaches to online PCA, namely, perturbation techniques, incremental methods and stochastic optimisation, and compares the most widely employed techniques in terms statistical accuracy, computation time and memory requirements using artificial and real data. Extensions of online PCA to missing data and to functional data are detailed. All studied algorithms are available in the  package onlinePCA on CRAN.},

  abstract = {Abstract Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is among the most classical classification techniques, while it continues to be a popular and important classifier in practice. However, the advancement of science and technology brings the new challenge of high-dimensional datasets, where the dimension can be in thousands. In such datasets, LDA is inapplicable. Recently, statisticians have devoted many efforts to creating high-dimensional LDA methods. These methods typically perform variable selection via regularization techniques. Various theoretical results, algorithms, and empirical results support the application of these methods. In this review, we provide a brief description of difficulties in extending LDA and present some successful proposals.

  abstract      = {Summary.  We introduce objective proper prior distributions for hypothesis testing and model selection based on measures of divergence between the competing models; we call them divergence-based (DB) priors. DB priors have simple forms and desirable properties like information (finite sample) consistency and are often similar to other existing proposals like intrinsic priors. Moreover, in normal linear model scenarios, they reproduce the Jeffreys–Zellner–Siow priors exactly. Most importantly, in challenging scenarios such as irregular models and mixture models, DB priors are well defined and very reasonable, whereas alternative proposals are not. We derive approximations to the DB priors as well as Markov chain Monte Carlo and asymptotic expressions for the associated Bayes factors.},

  abstract = {Summary.  Existing Bayesian model selection procedures require the specification of prior distributions on the parameters appearing in every model in the selection set. In practice, this requirement limits the application of Bayesian model selection methodology. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach towards Bayesian model selection that uses classical test statistics to compute Bayes factors between possible models. In several test cases, our approach produces results that are similar to previously proposed Bayesian model selection and model averaging techniques in which prior distributions were carefully chosen. In addition to eliminating the requirement to specify complicated prior distributions, this method offers important computational and algorithmic advantages over existing simulation-based methods. Because it is easy to evaluate the operating characteristics of this procedure for a given sample size and specified number of covariates, our method facilitates the selection of hyperparameter values through prior-predictive simulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Several alternative Bayes factors have been recently proposed in order to solve the problem of the extreme sensitivity of the Bayes factor to the priors of models under comparison. Specifically, the impossibility of using the Bayes factor with standard noninformative priors for model comparison has led to the introduction of new automatic criteria, such as the posterior Bayes factor (Aitkin 1991), the intrinsic Bayes factors (Berger and Pericchi 1996b) and the fractional Bayes factor (O'Hagan 1995). We derive some interesting properties of the fractional Bayes factor that provide justifications for its use additional to the ones given by O'Hagan. We further argue that the use of the fractional Bayes factor, originally introduced to cope with improper priors, is also useful in a robust analysis. Finally, using usual classes of priors, we compare several alternative Bayes factors for the problem of testing the point null hypothesis in the univariate normal model.},

Especially in the related work of nonlocal prior in regression setting, the scale parameter reflects the dispersion of the non-local prior density around zero, and implicitly determines the size of the regression coefficients that will be shrunk to zero. In this paper, we introduce a fully Bayesian approach with the pMOM nonlocal prior where we place an appropriate Inverse-Gamma prior on the tuning parameter to analyze a more robust model that is comparatively immune to misspecification of scale parameter. Under standard regularity assumptions, we extend the previous work where $p$ is bounded by the number of observations $n$ and establish strong model selection consistency when $p$ is allowed to increase at a polynomial rate with $n$. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our model selection procedure outperforms commonly used penalized likelihood methods in a range of simulation settings.},

  abstract    = {During the past decade, shrinkage priors have received much attention in Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we study the problem for high-dimensional linear regression models. We show that if the shrinkage prior has a heavy and flat tail, and allocates a sufficiently large probability mass in a very small neighborhood of zero, then its posterior properties are as good as those of the spike-and-slab prior. While enjoying its efficiency in Bayesian computation, the shrinkage prior can lead to a nearly optimal contraction rate and selection consistency as the spike-and-slab prior. Our numerical results show that under posterior consistency, Bayesian methods can yield much better results in variable selection than the regularization methods, such as Lasso and SCAD. We also establish a Bernstein von-Mises type results comparable to Castillo et al (2015), this result leads to a convenient way to quantify uncertainties of the regression coefficient estimates, which has been beyond the ability of regularization methods.},

  title       = {Bayesian Variable Selection for Ultrahigh-dimensional Sparse Linear Models},
  abstract    = {We propose a Bayesian variable selection procedure for ultrahigh-dimensional linear regression models. The number of regressors involved in regression, $p_n$, is allowed to grow exponentially with $n$. Assuming the true model to be sparse, in the sense that only a small number of regressors contribute to this model, we propose a set of priors suitable for this regime. The model selection procedure based on the proposed set of priors is shown to be variable selection consistent when all the $2^{p_n}$ models are considered. In the ultrahigh-dimensional setting, selection of the true model among all the $2^{p_n}$ possible ones involves prohibitive computation. To cope with this, we present a two-step model selection algorithm based on screening and Gibbs sampling. The first step of screening discards a large set of unimportant covariates, and retains a smaller set containing all the active covariates with probability tending to one. In the next step, we search for the best model among the covariates obtained in the screening step. This procedure is computationally quite fast, simple and intuitive. We demonstrate competitive performance of the proposed algorithm for a variety of simulated and real data sets when compared with several frequentist, as well as Bayesian methods.},

  abstract    = {The Schwarz or Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is one of the most widely used tools for model comparison in social science research. The BIC however is not suitable for evaluating models with order constraints on the parameters of interest. This paper explores two extensions of the BIC for evaluating order constrained models, one where a truncated unit information prior is used under the order-constrained model, and the other where a truncated local unit information prior is used. The first prior is centered around the maximum likelihood estimate and the latter prior is centered around a null value. Several analyses show that the order-constrained BIC based on the location unit information prior functions better as an Occam's razor for evaluating order-constrained models and results in lower error probabilities. The methodology is implemented in the R package `BFpack' which allows researchers to easily apply the method for order-constrained model selection. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated using data from the European Values Study.},

For example, it may be expected that the effect of the first predictor is larger than the effect of the second predictor, and the second predictor is expected to be larger than the third predictor. The goal is then to test such expectations against competing scientific expectations or theories. In this paper a simple default Bayes factor test is proposed for testing multiple hypotheses with equality and order constraints on the effects of interest. The proposed testing criterion can be computed without requiring external prior information about the expected effects before observing the data. The method is implemented in R-package called `{\tt lmhyp}' which is freely downloadable and ready to use.

We use the standard linear model, which assumes homoskedasticity, whereas the data are heteroskedastic, and observe that the posterior puts its mass on ever more high-dimensional models as the sample size increases. To remedy the problem, we equip the likelihood in Bayes' theorem with an exponent called the learning rate, and we propose the Safe Bayesian method to learn the learning rate from the data. SafeBayes tends to select small learning rates as soon the standard posterior is not `cumulatively concentrated', and its results on our data are quite encouraging.},

The new statistic can be explained as MCMC version of Wald test and has several important advantages that make it very convenient in practical applications. First, it is well-defined under improper prior distributions and avoids Jeffrey-Lindley's paradox. Second, it's asymptotic distribution can be proved to follow the $\chi^2$ distribution so that the threshold values can be easily calibrated from this distribution. Third, it's statistical error can be derived using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. Fourth, most importantly, it is only based on the posterior MCMC random samples drawn from the posterior distribution. Hence, it is only the by-product of the posterior outputs and very easy to compute. In addition, when the prior information is available, the finite sample theory is derived for the proposed test statistic. At last, the usefulness of the test is illustrated with several applications to latent variable models widely used in economics and finance.},

For the Bayesian approach to this problem, many authors have considered the behavior of the posterior distribution when, in truth, $Y=X\beta+\epsilon$ for some given $\beta$. There have been numerous results about the rate at which the posterior distribution concentrates around $\beta$, but few results about the shape of that posterior distribution. We propose a prior distribution for $b$ such that the marginal posterior distribution of an individual coordinate $b_i$ is asymptotically normal centered around an asymptotically efficient estimator, under the truth. Such a result gives Bayesian credible intervals that match with the confidence intervals obtained from an asymptotically efficient estimator for $b_i$. We also discuss ways of obtaining such asymptotically efficient estimators on individual coordinates. We compare the two-step procedure proposed by Zhang and Zhang (2014) and a one-step modified penalization method.},

Motivated by a recent work by Rockova and George (2014), we propose an EM algorithm that returns the MAP estimate of the set of relevant variables. Due to its particular updating scheme, our algorithm can be implemented efficiently without inverting a large matrix in each iteration and therefore can scale up with big data. We also show that the MAP estimate returned by our EM algorithm achieves variable selection consistency even when $p$ diverges with $n$. In practice, our algorithm could get stuck with local modes, a common problem with EM algorithms. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble EM algorithm, in which we repeatedly apply the EM algorithm on a subset of the samples with a subset of the covariates, and then aggregate the variable selection results across those bootstrap replicates. Empirical studies have demonstrated the superior performance of the ensemble EM algorithm.},

The method is based on the Kolmogorov distance and approximate samples from the Dirichlet process centered at the standard normal distribution and a concentration parameter 1. It is demonstrated that the proposed test is robust with respect to any prior specification of the Dirichlet process. A power comparison with several well-known tests is incorporated. In particular, the proposed test dominates the standard Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in all the cases examined in the paper.},

  title       = {Non-asymptotic theory for nonparametric testing},
  abstract    = {We consider nonparametric testing in a non-asymptotic framework. Our statistical guarantees are exact in the sense that Type I and II errors are controlled for any finite sample size. Meanwhile, one proposed test is shown to achieve minimax optimality in the asymptotic sense. An important consequence of this non-asymptotic theory is a new and practically useful formula for selecting the optimal smoothing parameter in nonparametric testing. The leading example in this paper is smoothing spline models under Gaussian errors. The results obtained therein can be further generalized to the kernel ridge regression framework under possibly non-Gaussian errors. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed test improves over the conventional asymptotic test when sample size is small to moderate.},

  title       = {Nonparametric Testing under Random Projection},
  abstract    = {A common challenge in nonparametric inference is its high computational complexity when data volume is large. In this paper, we develop computationally efficient nonparametric testing by employing a random projection strategy. In the specific kernel ridge regression setup, a simple distance-based test statistic is proposed. Notably, we derive the minimum number of random projections that is sufficient for achieving testing optimality in terms of the minimax rate. An adaptive testing procedure is further established without prior knowledge of regularity. One technical contribution is to establish upper bounds for a range of tail sums of empirical kernel eigenvalues. Simulations and real data analysis are conducted to support our theory.},

We apply our estimates to derive new quantitative results involving random variables that are non-linear functionals of random fields, namely: (i) a non-central quantitative de Jong theorem for sequences of degenerate U-statistics satisfying minimal uniform integrability conditions, significantly extending previous findings by de Jong (1990), Nourdin, Peccati and Reinert (2010) and D\"obler and Peccati (2016), (ii) a new Gamma approximation bound on the Poisson space, refining previous estimates by Peccati and Th\"ale (2013), and (iii) new Gamma bounds on a Gaussian space, strengthening estimates by Nourdin and Peccati (2009). As a by-product of our analysis, we also deduce a new inequality for Gamma approximations via exchangeable pairs, that is of independent interest.},

  abstract    = {In the first part of the paper we use a new Fourier technique to obtain a Stein characterizations for random variables in the second Wiener chaos. We provide the connection between this result and similar conclusions that can be derived using Malliavin calculus. We also introduce a new form of discrepancy which we use, in the second part of the paper, to provide bounds on the 2-Wasserstein distance between linear combinations of independent centered random variables. Our method of proof is entirely original. In particular it does not rely on estimation of bounds on solutions of the so-called Stein equations at the heart of Stein's method. We provide several applications, and discuss comparison with recent similar results on the same topic.},

  abstract    = {The variance-gamma (VG) distributions form a four parameter family that includes as special and limiting cases the normal, gamma and Laplace distributions. Some of the numerous applications include financial modelling and approximation on Wiener space. Recently, Stein's method has been extended to the VG distribution. However, technical difficulties have meant that bounds for distributional approximations have only been given for smooth test functions (typically requiring at least two derivatives for the test function). In this paper, which deals with symmetric variance-gamma (SVG) distributions, and a companion paper \cite{gaunt vgii}, which deals with the whole family of VG distributions, we address this issue. In this paper, we obtain new bounds for the derivatives of the solution of the SVG Stein equation, which allow for approximations to be made in the Kolmogorov and Wasserstein metrics, and also introduce a distributional transformation that is natural in the context of SVG approximation. We apply this theory to obtain Wasserstein or Kolmogorov error bounds for SVG approximation in four settings: comparison of VG and SVG distributions, SVG approximation of functionals of isonormal Gaussian processes, SVG approximation of a statistic for binary sequence comparison, and Laplace approximation of a random sum of independent mean zero random variables.},

We may want, for example, to have many zero entries, but without giving up too much of the stability of the MPP. One way to quantify stability is by how much the Frobenius norm of a generalized inverse exceeds that of the MPP. In this paper we derive finite-size concentration bounds for the Frobenius norm of $\ell^p$-minimal general inverses of iid Gaussian matrices, with $1 \leq p \leq 2$. For $p = 1$ we prove exponential concentration of the Frobenius norm of the sparse pseudoinverse; for $p = 2$, we get a similar concentration bound for the MPP. Our proof is based on the convex Gaussian min-max theorem, but unlike previous applications which give asymptotic results, we derive finite-size bounds.},

  title       = {A Bootstrap Lasso + Partial Ridge Method to Construct Confidence Intervals for Parameters in High-dimensional Sparse Linear Models},
  abstract    = {For high-dimensional sparse linear models, how to construct confidence intervals for coefficients remains a difficult question. The main reason is the complicated limiting distributions of common estimators such as the Lasso. Several confidence interval construction methods have been developed, and Bootstrap Lasso+OLS is notable for its simple technicality, good interpretability, and comparable performance with other more complicated methods. However, Bootstrap Lasso+OLS depends on the beta-min assumption, a theoretic criterion that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new method called Bootstrap Lasso+Partial Ridge (LPR) to relax this assumption. LPR is a two-stage estimator: first using Lasso to select features and subsequently using Partial Ridge to refit the coefficients. Simulation results show that Bootstrap LPR outperforms Bootstrap Lasso+OLS when there exist small but non-zero coefficients, a common situation violating the beta-min assumption. For such coefficients, compared to Bootstrap Lasso+OLS, confidence intervals constructed by Bootstrap LPR have on average 50% larger coverage probabilities. Bootstrap LPR also has on average 35% shorter confidence interval lengths than the de-sparsified Lasso methods, regardless of whether linear models are misspecified. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees of Bootstrap LPR under appropriate conditions and implement it in the R package "HDCI."},

  abstract    = {We propose a two-sample test for detecting the difference between mean vectors in a high-dimensional regime based on a ridge-regularized Hotelling's $T^2$. To choose the regularization parameter, a method is derived that aims at maximizing power within a class of local alternatives. We also propose a composite test that combines the optimal tests corresponding to a specific collection of local alternatives. Weak convergence of the stochastic process corresponding to the ridge-regularized Hotelling's $T^2$ is established and used to derive the cut-off values of the proposed test. Large sample properties are verified for a class of sub-Gaussian distributions. Through an extensive simulation study, the composite test is shown to compare favorably against a host of existing two-sample test procedure in a wide range of settings. The performance of the proposed test procedure is illustrated through an application to a breast cancer data set where the goal is to detect the pathways with different DNA copy number alterations across breast cancer subtypes.},

  abstract    = {Models with many signals, high-dimensional models, often impose structures on the signal strengths. The common assumption is that only a few signals are strong and most of the signals are zero or close (collectively) to zero. However, such a requirement might not be valid in many real-life applications. In this article, we are interested in conducting large-scale inference in models that might have signals of mixed strengths. The key challenge is that the signals that are not under testing might be collectively non-negligible (although individually small) and cannot be accurately learned. This article develops a new class of tests that arise from a moment matching formulation. A virtue of these moment-matching statistics is their ability to borrow strength across features, adapt to the sparsity size and exert adjustment for testing growing number of hypothesis. GRoup-level Inference of Parameter, GRIP, test harvests effective sparsity structures with hypothesis formulation for an efficient multiple testing procedure. Simulated data showcase that GRIPs error control is far better than the alternative methods. We develop a minimax theory, demonstrating optimality of GRIP for a broad range of models, including those where the model is a mixture of a sparse and high-dimensional dense signals.},

  title       = {A projection pursuit framework for testing general high-dimensional hypothesis},
  abstract    = {This article develops a framework for testing general hypothesis in high-dimensional models where the number of variables may far exceed the number of observations. Existing literature has considered less than a handful of hypotheses, such as testing individual coordinates of the model parameter. However, the problem of testing general and complex hypotheses remains widely open. We propose a new inference method developed around the hypothesis adaptive projection pursuit framework, which solves the testing problems in the most general case. The proposed inference is centered around a new class of estimators defined as $l_1$ projection of the initial guess of the unknown onto the space defined by the null. This projection automatically takes into account the structure of the null hypothesis and allows us to study formal inference for a number of long-standing problems. For example, we can directly conduct inference on the sparsity level of the model parameters and the minimum signal strength. This is especially significant given the fact that the former is a fundamental condition underlying most of the theoretical development in high-dimensional statistics, while the latter is a key condition used to establish variable selection properties. Moreover, the proposed method is asymptotically exact and has satisfactory power properties for testing very general functionals of the high-dimensional parameters. The simulation studies lend further support to our theoretical claims and additionally show excellent finite-sample size and power properties of the proposed test.},

  title       = {Two-sample testing in non-sparse high-dimensional linear models},
  abstract    = {In analyzing high-dimensional models, sparsity of the model parameter is a common but often undesirable assumption. In this paper, we study the following two-sample testing problem: given two samples generated by two high-dimensional linear models, we aim to test whether the regression coefficients of the two linear models are identical. We propose a framework named TIERS (short for TestIng Equality of Regression Slopes), which solves the two-sample testing problem without making any assumptions on the sparsity of the regression parameters. TIERS builds a new model by convolving the two samples in such a way that the original hypothesis translates into a new moment condition. A self-normalization construction is then developed to form a moment test. We provide rigorous theory for the developed framework. Under very weak conditions of the feature covariance, we show that the accuracy of the proposed test in controlling Type I errors is robust both to the lack of sparsity in the features and to the heavy tails in the error distribution, even when the sample size is much smaller than the feature dimension. Moreover, we discuss minimax optimality and efficiency properties of the proposed test. Simulation analysis demonstrates excellent finite-sample performance of our test. In deriving the test, we also develop tools that are of independent interest. The test is built upon a novel estimator, called Auto-aDaptive Dantzig Selector (ADDS), which not only automatically chooses an appropriate scale of the error term but also incorporates prior information. To effectively approximate the critical value of the test statistic, we develop a novel high-dimensional plug-in approach that complements the recent advances in Gaussian approximation theory.},

  title       = {A knockoff filter for high-dimensional selective inference},
  abstract    = {This paper develops a framework for testing for associations in a possibly high-dimensional linear model where the number of features/variables may far exceed the number of observational units. In this framework, the observations are split into two groups, where the first group is used to screen for a set of potentially relevant variables, whereas the second is used for inference over this reduced set of variables; we also develop strategies for leveraging information from the first part of the data at the inference step for greater power. In our work, the inferential step is carried out by applying the recently introduced knockoff filter, which creates a knockoff copy-a fake variable serving as a control-for each screened variable. We prove that this procedure controls the directional false discovery rate (FDR) in the reduced model controlling for all screened variables; this says that our high-dimensional knockoff procedure 'discovers' important variables as well as the directions (signs) of their effects, in such a way that the expected proportion of wrongly chosen signs is below the user-specified level (thereby controlling a notion of Type S error averaged over the selected set). This result is non-asymptotic, and holds for any distribution of the original features and any values of the unknown regression coefficients, so that inference is not calibrated under hypothesized values of the effect sizes. We demonstrate the performance of our general and flexible approach through numerical studies, showing more power than existing alternatives. Finally, we apply our method to a genome-wide association study to find locations on the genome that are possibly associated with a continuous phenotype.},

  title       = {Robust inference with knockoffs},
  abstract    = {We consider the variable selection problem, which seeks to identify important variables influencing a response $Y$ out of many candidate features $X_1, \ldots, X_p$. We wish to do so while offering finite-sample guarantees about the fraction of false positives - selected variables $X_j$ that in fact have no effect on $Y$ after the other features are known. When the number of features $p$ is large (perhaps even larger than the sample size $n$), and we have no prior knowledge regarding the type of dependence between $Y$ and $X$, the model-X knockoffs framework nonetheless allows us to select a model with a guaranteed bound on the false discovery rate, as long as the distribution of the feature vector $X=(X_1,\dots,X_p)$ is exactly known. This model selection procedure operates by constructing "knockoff copies'" of each of the $p$ features, which are then used as a control group to ensure that the model selection algorithm is not choosing too many irrelevant features. In this work, we study the practical setting where the distribution of $X$ could only be estimated, rather than known exactly, and the knockoff copies of the $X_j$'s are therefore constructed somewhat incorrectly. Our results, which are free of any modeling assumption whatsoever, show that the resulting model selection procedure incurs an inflation of the false discovery rate that is proportional to our errors in estimating the distribution of each feature $X_j$ conditional on the remaining features $\{X_k:k\neq j\}$. The model-X knockoff framework is therefore robust to errors in the underlying assumptions on the distribution of $X$, making it an effective method for many practical applications, such as genome-wide association studies, where the underlying distribution on the features $X_1,\dots,X_p$ is estimated accurately but not known exactly.},

  title       = {The conditional permutation test},
  abstract    = {We propose a general new method, the \emph{conditional permutation test}, for testing the conditional independence of variables $X$ and $Y$ given a potentially high-dimensional random vector $Z$ that may contain confounding factors. The proposed test permutes entries of $X$ non-uniformly, so as to respect the existing dependence between $X$ and $Z$ and thus account for the presence of these confounders. Like the conditional randomization test of \citet{candes2018panning}, our test relies on the availability of an approximation to the distribution of $X \mid Z$---while \citet{candes2018panning}'s test uses this estimate to draw new $X$ values, for our test we use this approximation to design an appropriate non-uniform distribution on permutations of the $X$ values already seen in the true data. We provide an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for the implementation of our method, and establish bounds on the Type~I error in terms of the error in the approximation of the conditional distribution of $X\mid Z$, finding that, for the worst case test statistic, the inflation in Type I error of the conditional permutation test is no larger than that of the conditional randomization test. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on simulated data and on the Capital Bikeshare data set.},

It is a collection of statistical methods for estimation and quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. It focuses on providing confidence intervals and significance testing for (possibly many) low-dimensional subcomponents of the high-dimensional parameter vector. Efficient estimators and uniformly valid confidence intervals for regression coefficients on target variables (e.g., treatment or policy variable) in a high-dimensional approximately sparse regression model, for average treatment effect (ATE) and average treatment effect for the treated (ATET), as well for extensions of these parameters to the endogenous setting are provided. Theory grounded, data-driven methods for selecting the penalization parameter in Lasso regressions under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian errors are implemented. Moreover, joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals for regression coefficients of a high-dimensional sparse regression are implemented. Data sets which have been used in the literature and might be useful for classroom demonstration and for testing new estimators are included.},

  title       = {Asymptotic Theory of Eigenvectors for Large Random Matrices},
  year        = {2019},
  abstract    = {Characterizing the exact asymptotic distributions of high-dimensional eigenvectors for large structured random matrices poses important challenges yet can provide useful insights into a range of applications. To this end, in this paper we introduce a general framework of asymptotic theory of eigenvectors (ATE) for large structured symmetric random matrices with heterogeneous variances, and establish the asymptotic properties of the spiked eigenvectors and eigenvalues for the scenario of the generalized Wigner matrix noise, where the mean matrix is assumed to have the low-rank structure. Under some mild regularity conditions, we provide the asymptotic expansions for the spiked eigenvalues and show that they are asymptotically normal after some normalization. For the spiked eigenvectors, we establish novel asymptotic expansions for the general linear combination and further show that it is asymptotically normal after some normalization, where the weight vector can be arbitrary. We also provide a more general asymptotic theory for the spiked eigenvectors using the bilinear form. Simulation studies verify the validity of our new theoretical results. Our family of models encompasses many popularly used ones such as the stochastic block models with or without overlapping communities for network analysis and the topic models for text analysis, and our general theory can be exploited for statistical inference in these large-scale applications.},
