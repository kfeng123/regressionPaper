  abstract = {Summary.  We introduce objective proper prior distributions for hypothesis testing and model selection based on measures of divergence between the competing models; we call them divergence-based (DB) priors. DB priors have simple forms and desirable properties like information (finite sample) consistency and are often similar to other existing proposals like intrinsic priors. Moreover, in normal linear model scenarios, they reproduce the Jeffreys–Zellner–Siow priors exactly. Most importantly, in challenging scenarios such as irregular models and mixture models, DB priors are well defined and very reasonable, whereas alternative proposals are not. We derive approximations to the DB priors as well as Markov chain Monte Carlo and asymptotic expressions for the associated Bayes factors.},

  abstract = {Abstract Several alternative Bayes factors have been recently proposed in order to solve the problem of the extreme sensitivity of the Bayes factor to the priors of models under comparison. Specifically, the impossibility of using the Bayes factor with standard noninformative priors for model comparison has led to the introduction of new automatic criteria, such as the posterior Bayes factor (Aitkin 1991), the intrinsic Bayes factors (Berger and Pericchi 1996b) and the fractional Bayes factor (O'Hagan 1995). We derive some interesting properties of the fractional Bayes factor that provide justifications for its use additional to the ones given by O'Hagan. We further argue that the use of the fractional Bayes factor, originally introduced to cope with improper priors, is also useful in a robust analysis. Finally, using usual classes of priors, we compare several alternative Bayes factors for the problem of testing the point null hypothesis in the univariate normal model.},

  abstract = {Abstract We consider sparse Bayesian estimation in the classical multivariate linear regression model with p regressors and q response variables. In univariate Bayesian linear regression with a single response y , shrinkage priors which can be expressed as scale mixtures of normalnormal densities are popular for obtaining sparse estimates of the coefficients. In this paper, we extend the use of these priors to the multivariate case to estimate a p × q coefficients matrix B . We derive sufficient conditions for posterior consistency under the Bayesian multivariate linear regression framework and prove that our method achieves posterior consistency even when p &gt; n andeven when p grows at nearly exponential rate with the sample size. We derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm and provide the implementation in a comprehensive R package called MBSP. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations and data analysis that our model has excellent finite sample performance. },

  abstract      = {Summary.  We examine philosophical problems and sampling deficiencies that are associated with current Bayesian hypothesis testing methodology, paying particular attention to objective Bayes methodology. Because the prior densities that are used to define alternative hypotheses in many Bayesian tests assign non‐negligible probability to regions of the parameter space that are consistent with null hypotheses, resulting tests provide exponential accumulation of evidence in favour of true alternative hypotheses, but only sublinear accumulation of evidence in favour of true null hypotheses. Thus, it is often impossible for such tests to provide strong evidence in favour of a true null hypothesis, even when moderately large sample sizes have been obtained. We review asymptotic convergence rates of Bayes factors in testing precise null hypotheses and propose two new classes of prior densities that ameliorate the imbalance in convergence rates that is inherited by most Bayesian tests. Using members of these classes, we obtain analytic expressions for Bayes factors in linear models and derive approximations to Bayes factors in large sample settings.},
